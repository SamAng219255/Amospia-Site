<p><a href="?target=.%2Fmisc%2FCalculator%2F">"Calculator"</a> is my attempt at building a graphing calculator in a browser.</p>
<p>It has function and parametric modes. Higher precision values slow down calculations. It has no visual effect over 500. Default click detection will look at the point on the function directly in line with the cursor on the vertical axis. Nearest calculates the nearest point on the graph instead.</p>

<p>The <a href="./misc/rgb/">RGB sliders page</a> is just a set of basic rgb sliders with not much else that set the background color of the page via the sliders.</p>
<br>
<p><a href="./misc/palette/">Random Palette Generator</a> generates 4 random colors every time you reload the page and displays them next to each other with their hexadecimal values. The frequency of colors has been adjusted such that there is a more equal visual distribution of colors.</p>
<br>
<p><a href="./misc/lined/">Line Drawing</a> is a blank canvas on which you can click and drag to draw with your mouse. Once you let go of the mouse, it draws straight lines over top that match the corners of your original drawing. Pressing "Enter" or starting a new line will clear the canvas.</p>

<p>This copy of <a href="./misc/Alchahemistry/">Alchahemistry</a> is my work in progress version where I'm planning on reinventing the alchemy system as well as adding a semi-3d enviroment and a turn-based combat system.</p>
<p>Currently, It's just a platform floating in a void with some test sprites.
Eventually, It will include a customizable base containing a forge, and an enchanting station which will make up the "alchemy" system in the new system. In addition there will be more story and multiplayer options including opening worlds for specific players to join and a global battlefield.</p>
