<p><a href="?target=.%2Fmisc%2FCalculator%2F">"Calculator"</a> is my attempt at building a graphing calculator in a browser.</p>
<p>It has function and parametric modes. Higher precision values slow down calculations. It has no visual effect over 500. Default click detction will look at the point on the function directly in line with the cursor on the vertical axis. Nearest calculates the nearest point the grpah instead.</p>

<p>The <a href="./misc/rgb/">RGB sliders page</a> is just a set of basic rgb sliders with not much else that set the background color of the page via the sliders.</p>

<p>This copy of <a href="./misc/Alchahemistry/">Alchahemistry</a> is my work in progress version where I'm planning on reinventing the alchemy system as well as adding a semi-3d enviroment and a turn-based combat system.</p>
<p>Currently, It's just a 3d bedroom made entirely of html and css code.
Eventually, It will include a customizable base containing a forge, and an enchanting station which will make up the "alchemy" system in the new system. In addition there will be more story and multiplayer options including opening worlds for specific players to join and a global battlefield.</p>
