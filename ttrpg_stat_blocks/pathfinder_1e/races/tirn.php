		"It is truly a miracle that these pepople continue to exist. Each day is a dangerous one for a Tirn, hiding collections of caves and attempting to forage during the night. Tirn are physically quite weak and are forced to make up for it by relying on each other and on the those of number with the cunning and intelligence to keep the rest alive.",
		"Tirn are short, even for the short folk of the world, with average adult height coming out to only a little over 2 feet. This is in part due to their near constant malnutrition as they are incapable of competing for food. This gives them a similarly gaunt frame and they are easily mistaken for a malnourished halfling child. Tirn spend most the time squinting as they grown accustomed to the darkness of their caves.",
		"Tirn possess little in the way of a society but they do form communities for strength in numbers with the sick and injured being cared for while the strong and cunning attempt to collect resources. Larger groups often manage to grow edible mushrooms within their caves but struggle producing enough food to feed everyone.",
		"Tirn are paranoid and will generally run away at the sight of the larger races preventing relations from effectively forming though some lucky groups have warmed up to halfling caravans that pass through their region and often supply aid.",
		"Tirn often think little of philosophical topics and only rarely practice religion. Most fall into either true neutral or neutral good alignments, evil Tirn are unheard of as their perpetual reliance on one another and bad conditions make them seek to protect one another.",
		"Tirn rarely become adventurers though some (relatively) brave few will leave their communities and attempt to seek a better fortune, often as casters as their physical weakness makes them ill-suited to enter melee.",

			"Swarming: Tirn are used to living and fighting communally with other members of their race. Up to two Tirn can share the same square at the same time. If two Tirn that are occupying the same square attack the same foe, they are considered to be flanking that foe as if they were in two opposite squares.",
