		"The plant races of the Tangled Grove live together hidden largely from the rest of the world by their mystical forest. It is in the center of which grow new Sproutlings that grow into the adult members of the community. There are several species within the grove, each with their own role to play.",
		"Aniflors are most similar to the humanoid races having smooth plant-like skin that can be green, purple, red, any color in between. A tuft of decorative leaves can be found atop their head that function similar to hair. These leaves generally come in all the same colors as their skin but much more vibrant, though some have leaves which can come in any color and have pigments and structures more similar to petals despite being leaf-like in overall structure and shape.",
		"Each species within the grove has their own role with the wise Redwoods keeping a history and leading the people, the Nightshades functioning as skilled hunters gathering meat and keeping so-called animal races from discovering them, the Lo'raks guarding from the undead horde at their other border and the versatile Aniflor filling in the other roles. Despite these nearly predetermined roles, each individual may choose their profession and many work outside their roles.
		Aniflor possess no specialization but rather form the bulk of the population fullfilling roles such as baker, tanner, or farmer.",
		"The inhabitants of the grove generally attempt to avoid contact with the animal races outside but there are stories of walking plant monsters hidden within the dangerous forest and some leave and are shunned as outcast or paraded as curiosities. The few outsiders that know anything about them are the druids of the animal races. The Grove are also in continuous war with a neighboring scourge of undead held back primarily through their efforts.",
		"The alignment of the inhabitants varies wildly but only few evil ones have been known and most are true neutral. Most of the members follow the green faith.",
		"Few members of the races from the Grove leave but those that do are seen as outcasts and tend to find themselves roaming from place to place often ending up in adventuring parties.",

Clerics who are Redwoods with the Plant domain use their domain powers and spells at +1 caster level. This trait does not give Redwoods early access to level-based powers; it only affects powers that they could already use without this trait.",
