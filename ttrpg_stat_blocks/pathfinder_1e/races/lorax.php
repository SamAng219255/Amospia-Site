		"The plant races of the Tangled Grove live together hidden largely from the rest of the world by their mystical forest. It is in the center of which grow new Sproutlings that grow into the adult members of the community. There are several species within the grove, each with their own role to play.",
		"Lo'raks are mostly humanoid with an exoskeleton of gray bark protecting them. Beneath the bark is a yellow-white flesh simialr to plant stems. Lo'raks have a wide build but move with a surprising grace.",
		"Each species within the grove has their own role with the wise Redwoods keeping a history and leading the people, the Nightshades functioning as skilled hunters gathering meat and keeping so-called animal races from discovering them, the Lo'raks guarding from the undead horde at their other border and the versatile Aniflor filling in the other roles. Despite these nearly predetermined roles, each individual may choose their profession and many work outside their roles.
		Lo'raks form the major bulk of the army protecting the Grove from the nearby horde of undead though many also take up guard positions thoughout the Grove. Lo'raks have a strict hierarchy of military command with each one holding a rank and promotions being given occasionally for exemplary work. While not an official rule, no non-Lo'rak has ever held the rank of centenar within the ranks of the army, nor have eny been granted a higher rank.",
		"The inhabitants of the grove generally attempt to avoid contact with the animal races outside but there are stories of walking plant monsters hidden within the dangerous forest and some leave and are shunned as outcast or paraded as curiosities. The few outsiders that know anything about them are the druids of the animal races. The Grove are also in continuous war with a neighboring scourge of undead held back primarily through their efforts.",
		"The alignment of the inhabitants varies wildly but only few evil ones have been known and most are true neutral. Most of the members follow the green faith.",
		"Few members of the races from the Grove leave but those that do are seen as outcasts and tend to find themselves roaming from place to place often ending up in adventuring parties.",

		"Lo'raks boast incredible strength while remaining quite nimble. Lo'raks are also quite hardy, able to withstand many blows, though their intelligence leaves something to be desired with most simply following orders without a second thought.",

To gain the benefits of a night's rest a Lo'rak must spend 8 hours performing light activity such as meditating.",
			"Normal Speed: Lo'raks have a base speed of 30 feet.",
			"Low-Light Vision: Lo'raks can see twice as far as humans in conditions of dim light.",
			"Necromantic Sight: Using anti-undead necromantic magic, Lo'raks have been given the ability to sense undead. All Lo'raks are treated as though effected by a continuous ii/detect undead/ii spell.",
			"Ancient Foe: Lo'raks gain a +2 dodge bonus to AC against undead and a +2 racial bonus on combat maneuver checks made to grapple undead. Lo'raks also gain a +1 racial bonus on attack rolls against undead.",
