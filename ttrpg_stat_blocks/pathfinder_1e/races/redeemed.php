		"Many centuries ago, the ancestors of the Redeemed were succubi and incubi exiled to the material plane following a failed coup of a demon lord and the subsequent death of their queen. After some time their essence was slowly modified by the material plane eventually allowing them to birth mortal children. These children were less inclined to the parents evil ways and after a few generations they overthrew them. In time they became more and more diverse in their alignments though their appearance has changed little and they have preserved some portion of their gifts. Redeemed have made themselves many demonic enemies in their history as they have foght to diffrentiate themselves from their demonic ancestors.",
		"Redeemed appear to be particularly beautiful or handsome humans though with bat-like vestigial wings and some members also have one or two small horns or possibly a long sinuous tail.",
		"Redeemed primarily live in a cluster of villages each with a ruling village council which each send a representative to a form a council ruling over their cluster of villages. In years past their would be much politicking and intrigue among these councils but they have since settled down and tend to be filled with wise village elders.",
		"Redeemed are often shunned by those that recognise their people and know their lineage seeing them as untrustworthy at best. Redeemed for their part have mostly given up changing the minds of other races and often lean into this portrayal when interacting with them. On occasion, cultists attempt to take advantage of their lineage and believe them to be the key to great power but are often met with disapointment when met with annoyed villagers instead of powerful demons.",
		"Redeemed run the full gamut of alignments but tend towards chaotic alignments and away from the evil alignments asociated with their ancestors.
		Many Redeemed worship Sarenrae and most of the rest have some connection to her as when the Redeemed first took up the fight against evil, she admired their resolve granting them aid and helped them to overcome their demonic tendencies, ultimately granted them the title of Redeemed.",
		"Redeemed often become adventurers either for a taste of adventure or to lead crusades against various demonic forces. A rare few evil ones seek to reinvigorate their demonic connection and seek power. Adventuring is seen as a viable and even normal profession amongst their villages. Many individuals go adventuring as soon as they can and return after reaching great heights. Meaning that their villages have more than their fair sure of high level adventurers in them that often settle down and tell stories to their kids and the other village children of their daring adventures inpiring new generations of adventurers.",
