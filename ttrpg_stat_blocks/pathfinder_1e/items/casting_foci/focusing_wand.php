Additionally, a ii/focusing wand/ii is treated as having an enhancement bonus one and a half times its actual enhancement bonus rounded up and if it has no enhancement bonus it is treated as having an enhancement bonus of +1. Spells cast using this wand generally originate from the tip if coming from the caster's square and the standard somatic movements involved with the spell are replaced by skilled waving of the wand.
		A ii/focusing wand/ii can be made into a normal wand in addition to its properties as a casting focus in which case the bonus also affects spells cast from it. It can also be made into a metamagic rod instead. In either case it costs as much to convert it as out would to create a new item of that type.",
