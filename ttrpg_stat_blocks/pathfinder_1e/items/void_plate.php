		'Designed by the Drow, this elegant armor is made numerous thin plates of adamantine interwoven together to distribute the weight and the force of impact while allowing the wearer to move comfortably. Despite its composition, the armor does not confer damage reduction normally associated with adamantine. Rather the strength of the metal is used to make it ultra-light while maintaining coverage and strength comparable to steel full plate armor. Void Plate counts as light armor for purposes of movement and other limitations. This does not apply to proficiency in wearing the armor. A character wearing Void Plate must be proficient in wearing heavy armor to avoid adding the armorâ€™s check penalty on all his attack rolls and skill checks that involve moving.
Void Plate has 30 hit points and 20 hardness.'
