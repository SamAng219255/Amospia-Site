He fell in Akrathesh, and she with him, and they courted quickly and married soon after. As life arose upon the world, many gods began sculpting races of followers from elements and from the budding life upon the world. It was in this era that Akrathesh and Indrak worked together and transformed a colony of island boars into a new race as their beloved children. They named this race proceakran. \n Modernly, Indrak is worshiped as a god of fire and disasters but also as a god of the forge and war by his children, the porceakran."
