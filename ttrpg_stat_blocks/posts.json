				"It's been a bit since the last major update but I've added quite a few sections since my last post. I've begun updating the Pf 1st Ed Cosmere topic for the recent books and I've added all of the Starfinder races I've written, along with descriptions of them. That's all I got for now though. Again, feel free to contact me with comments, questions, and suggestions!"

				"Alrighty, small update: I've officially entered all of the warcraft setting races I've written out so far, future warcraft race projects may include arathi, niffen, tol'vir, and possibly brokers and djaradin. I'll probably move on to adding the some of the general races or some more of the classes I've been adding."

				"I'm trucking along on entering the stat blocks I wrote over the last two years and it's been a bit slow going as I've started school and have been juggling other responsiblilities.",
				"I decided on an official name for this site, Mordan's Tower, along with icons. The name is based on a setting I am working on writing. The setting will be a ways coming though sadly as I want to push out the backlog before dedicating the time the new stuff will take because I'm not actually just writing a new setting, I'm writing a new system based on Pathfinder First Edition and older editions of D&D! This system, and all relevant materials, will be found here on my website under a new section up top as Amasthia Adventures, Amasthia being the name of the world. The system is largely compatible with Pathfinder 1st Ed and D&D 3.5, probably about as much as they are to each other. Some things will be renamed however, with some systems being simplified while others are given more detail. Depending on interest and assuming its any good, I may also see about selling physical rulebooks for the system when the time comes. To garner some interest in what's to come, the primary themes I selected for the new setting are \"Wilderness vs Civilization\", \"The Power of the One\", \"Morality is Complicated\", \"Oaths\", and \"Oppression and Prejudice\" with an additional design principle of a \"Fog of Understanding\" where the lore is always told through in-universe writings meaning that everything is subject to unreliable narrators and personal bias. I also plan to have more diverse cultural divides other than \"this is the human language, culture, and nation, this the the dwarven language, culture, and nation, and this is the elven language, culture, and nation and they are all completely unrelated with no mixing\" which always bugged me a bit.",
				"On that note, this time I've added all the new \"narman\" variations found under the Amospia topic, updated several mobs and added the Breeze and Bogged under the Minecraft topic, added more races under the Warcraft topic, begun adding the Dragon Eater class, and updated a handful of other stat blocks not found under a topic.",
				"Updates will probably continue to come sporadically as I enter in all of the new stuff. To look forward to: 132 new or updated pf 1st ed races (including the ones already added), 24 new pf 1st ed monsters, 26 new artifacts (including two new types of artifacts), 5 new casting foci, 32 new special materials, 68 new spells, ~17 new classes, 72 new advanced alchemy recipes, 92 new starfinder races, and ~142 new starfinder weapons. These number are quick calculations are the exact counts may vary. This list is also not complete and there are many more things I wrote that I plan to add.",
				"With all that out of the way, I hope you enjoy the content I already have published and the stuff yet to come, I know the quality of my work has increased drastically so this new stuff should be more polished than the old stuff. And again, if you have any comments or suggestions, or just want to let me know if you are enjoying by creations, let me know at samang033146085@gmail.com, happy gaming!"

				"Well, it seems the old email may be unretrievable but the I have managed to switch my accounts and the repository is once again being updated. samang033146085@gmail.com will now be the email to reach me at going forward.",
				"I have already started adding some of my new stat blocks and have covered all of the new items including several wondrous items and two new categories of items. I also divided the magic wondrous items by type properly instead of leaving them all under wondrous items.",
				"Next, I am adding a new topic section, Warcraft, which will contain numerous races native to setting of the games. I am also starting on some of the planned graphical changes, making the site a little less blank and adding more accessibility options.",

				"Hello Everyone! I'm back at it and ready to add the several hundred new stat blocks I have created over the past few years but have been unable to. I am also going to be back on trying to fix errors though the email I planned to use this website with is currently unable to be reached so (temporarily) the repository of the site will not be updated with the website and any questions or comments should be directed to samang033146085@gmail.com instead. If you tried to reach me over the years I was absent hoping I would see it upon my return, I would kindly request that you forward it to the new temporary email.",
				"Looking to future projects, I'm planning to reorganize these stat blocks into \"books\" instead of the current \"settings\" and \"topics\". \"Topics\" will still be separated into their own section in the general navigation but (hopefully) most stat blocks will also be divided into books which share a common theme or world setting. I also intend to create my own system, based on Pathfinder 1st Edition's rules, which will have an entirely custom setting. When I add it, it will be at the top of the navigation, listed with the other systems. Most of the stat blocks will probably be at least mostly portable into Pathfinder 1st Edition and vice versa, similar to the compatibility of Dungeons and Dragon 3.5 Edition and Pathfinder 1st Edition. My last major plan going forward is to spruce up the design of the website by adding more detailed backgrounds and additional page theme options to increase accessibility and add some style to the page.",
				"If you have any comments or suggestions regarding these changes, or anything else on this site for that matter, feel free to email me at my current temporary email or at samang219255@gmail.com once I regain control of it. Happy gaming!"

				"I am going to to be absent for the next two years and will be unable to maintain this site during that time. It should remain up and functional but I will be unable to add, complete, or fix anything on the site during this time. I should return and be able to continue around July of 2024."
