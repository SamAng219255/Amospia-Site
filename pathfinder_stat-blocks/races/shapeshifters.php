		"The accidental result of arcane experiments attempting to use aphorites as a base to blend the ever shifting nature of proteans with the malleable forms of doppelgangers using a modified form of drow fleshcrafting in an attempt ot create the ultimate infiltration spies, shape shifters are a strange race with no natural form that can assume many different forms. Shape shifters can have children with any race whose shape they are currently in and these children may or may not be born as shape shifters, those that are sometimes can innately change their shape from the moment they are born while others may not manifest their abilities for many years. Those born as unintelligent races who have not yet gained access to their shapeshifting are barely more intelligent than their peers until they gain their abilities at which point awareness comes upon them suddenly.",
		"Shape shifters have no natural form but can most easily take the form of humanoid creatures and some may have a preference to one form over another.",
		"Shape shifters often live in the societies of humanoid creatues attempting to blend in either living a mostly normal life or using their abilities to gain power and wealth.",
		"Shape shifters are often met with the same reactions as doppelgangers once identified as many people can't tell the difference.",
		"Shape shifters come in all alignments but many tend slightly toward being more chaotic.",
		"Shape shifters often feel like outcasts and are prone to become adventureers travelling from place to place.",

		"Shape shifters are often strong and have a silver tongue but are rarely cunning or studious having a hard time focusing on training or studying.",

			"Medium: Shape shifter are Medium creatures and have no bonuses or penalties due to their size.",
			"Monstrous Humanoid: Shape shifters are monstrous humanoids with the shapechanger subtype.",
			"Normal Speed: Shape shifters have a base speed of 30 feet.",
			"Darkvision: Shape shifters can see in the dark up to 60 feet.",
			"Chaotic Mind: Shape shifters have often have their thoughts jumbled with those of the different forms they frequent with many prone to disociative identity disorders. This chaotic mental state makes them hard to magically read or influence granting them a +2 racial bonus to will saves.",
			"Natural Armor: Shape shifters can adjust their skin to become more durable granting them a +2 enhancement bonus to natural armor that stacks with all other bonuses and natural armor. This applies regardless of what form they are in.",
			"Change Appearance: Shape shifters can change their form to that of any other small or medium humanoid as ii/alter self/ii with the exceptions that they do so as a swift action and that they do not gain the changes to their ability scores, rather when changing to the form of a small creature they lose their bonus to strength and instead gain a +2 bonus to dexterity. This is a supernatural ability. Whenever they change form with this ability it becomes their natural form. Changing their form is a polymorph effect meaning the shape shifter is constantly treated as already under the effects of a polymorph effect so long as they are not in the area of an anti-magic effect.",
			"Polymorphic: Shape shifters can cast ii/polymorph/ii on themself as a supernatual ability using their number of hit dice as their level. When the shape shifter is transformed using this ability they can choose to retain the ability to speak any language they know in addition to being able to make normal sounds as that type of creature.",
			"Languages: Shape shifters begin play speaking Common. Shape shifters with high Intelligence scores can choose any languages they want (except secret languages, such as Druidic)."
