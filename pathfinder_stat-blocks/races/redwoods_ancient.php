		"The plant races of the Tangled Grove live together hidden largely from the rest of the world by their mystical forest. It is in the center of which grow new Sproutlings that grow into the adult members of the community. There are several species within the grove, each with their own role to play.",
		"Taller than the other races in the Grove and the animal race of humans, Redwoods stand mighty and regal. The younger adults stand around seven tall but they wil keep growing with many of the ancients standing 15 feet. Their skin is composed of solid reddish bark and the rest of their flesh is hard red wood. Their limbs are thick and slow to move.",
		"Each species within the grove has their own role with the wise Redwoods keeping a history and leading the people, the Nightshades functioning as skilled hunters gathering meat and keeping so-called animal races from discovering them, the Lo'raks guarding from the undead horde at their other border and the versatile Aniflor filling in the other roles. Despite these nearly predetermined roles, each individual may choose their profession and many work outside their roles.
		Redwoods are generally in charge of maintaining the archives and sitting on a council that makes decisions for the Grove. Their archives are primarily composed of special ancient trees which remember the information whom the Redwoods communicate with to store or retrieve the informartion. Redwoods follow a strict chain of seniority in their work with the younger following all commands given by their elders.",
		"The inhabitants of the grove generally attempt to avoid contact with the animal races outside but there are stories of walking plant monsters hidden within the dangerous forest and some leave and are shunned as outcast or paraded as curiosities. The few outsiders that know anything about them are the druids of the animal races. The Grove are also in continuous war with a neighboring scourge of undead held back primarily through their efforts.",
		"The alignment of the inhabitants varies wildly but only few evil ones have been known and most are true neutral. Most of the members follow the green faith.",
		"Few members of the races from the Grove leave but those that do are seen as outcasts and tend to find themselves roaming from place to place often ending up in adventuring parties.",

			"Large: Ancient Redwoods are Large creatures and gain a -1 penalty to their AC, a -1 penalty on attack rolls, a +1 size bonus on combat maneuver checks and to their Combat Maneuver Defense, and a -4 penalty on Stealth checks. Ancient Redwoods also gain a reach of 10 feet.",
			"Plants: Redwoods are plants making them immune to all mind affecting effects, paralysis, poison, polymorph effects, sleep effects, and stunning. Plants breathe and eat but do not sleep.

On character creation, pick two Knowledge skills. The Ancient Redwood gains a +2 racial bonus on both of these skills, and those skills are treated as class skills regardless of what class the Ancient Redwood actually takes.",
			"Focused Study: At 1st, 8th, and 16th level Ancient Redwoods gain the Skill Focus feat in a skill of their choice.",
			"Fertile Soil: Sorcerer Redwoods with the verdant bloodline treat their Charisma score as 2 points higher for all sorcerer spells and class abilities. Clerics who are Redwoods with the Plant domain use their domain powers and spells at +1 caster level. This trait does not give Redwoods early access to level-based powers; it only affects powers that they could already use without this trait.",
			"Languages: Redwoods begin play speaking Sylvan. Redwoods with high Intelligence scores can choose from the following languages: Aquan, Auran, Common, Elven, Ignan, Terran, and Treant."
