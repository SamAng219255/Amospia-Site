		"Many centuries ago, the ancestors of the Redeemed were succubi and incubi exiled to the material plane following a failed coup of a demon lord and the subsequent death of their queen. After some time their essence was slowly modified by the material plane eventually allowing them to birth mortal children. These children were less inclined to the parents evil ways and after a few generations they overthrew them. In time they became more and more diverse in their alignments though their appearance has changed little and they have preserved some portion of their gifts. Redeemed have made themselves many demonic enemies in their history as they have foght to diffrentiate themselves from their demonic ancestors.

A rare few evil ones seek to reinvigorate their demonic connection and seek power. Adventuring is seen as a viable and even normal profession amongst their villages. Many individuals go adventuring as soon as they can and return after reaching great heights. Meaning that their villages have more than their fair sure of high level adventurers in them that often settle down and tell stories to their kids and the other village children of their daring adventures inpiring new generations of adventurers.",
