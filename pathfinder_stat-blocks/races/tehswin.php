		"While far from common it is not unheard of in some circles for proteans to have relations with mortals some of which result in children called Tehswin. Tehswin are often agents of chaos like their protean parents and their forms are quite malleable allowing them to take a wide variety of forms.",
		"Tehswin have a humanoid form that looks like their mortal parent's race with various uncanny changes but they often transform into various forms on a whim.",
		"Tehswin generally don't have their own society, rather they often sow chaos among those of other mortals. Tehswin will often adopt warped versions of the customs and mannerisms of their mortal parents.",
		"Tehswin are rare enough that they do not have a reputation as a group but their actions and tendency for shape shifting often earns them the distrust of the societies they find themselves in. Tehswin often avoid this by changing forms to pretend to be someone else when discovered and the communities where they frequent are often suspicious of outsiders for this reason.",
		"Tehswin are born with an innate need to spread chaos and are nearly always chaotic though it is possible for the rare individual to fight this urge and to be lawful. As for the other axis of alignment, Tehswin are more often neutral but many are evil or good, though evil is more common as being evil is more freeing to fulfill their innate urges.",
		"Tehswin may become bored of their current location at any time and will often leave for elsewhere with some never settling down and instead becoming adventurers travelling from place to place. Adventuring Tehswin often do not get along with paladin or monk party members and may enjoy tormenting them while.",
