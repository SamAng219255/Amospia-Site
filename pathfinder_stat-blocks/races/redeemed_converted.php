		"Many centuries ago, the ancestors of the Redeemed were succubi and incubi exiled to the material plane following a failed coup of a demon lord and the subsequent death of their queen. After some time their essence was slowly modified by the material plane eventually allowing them to birth mortal children. These children were less inclined to the parents evil ways and after a few generations they overthrew them. In time they became more and more diverse in their alignments though their appearance has changed little and they have preserved some portion of their gifts. Redeemed have made themselves many demonic enemies in their history as they have foght to diffrentiate themselves from their demonic ancestors.
		Some Redeemed have sought to bring more meaning to the named goven to them and have devoted themselves to being good and fighting the forces of evil. Some of these mighty warriors have at different times received a blessing from Sarenrae converting their demonic nature into an angelic one. These rare individuals and their descendants are called Converted Redeemed or simply Converted.",
		"Converted Redeemed appear to be particularly beautiful or handsome humans though with white feathery vestigial wings.",
		"Redeemed primarily live in a cluster of villages each with a ruling village council which each send a representative to a form a council ruling over their cluster of villages. In years past their would be much politicking and intrigue among these councils but they have since settled down and tend to be filled with wise village elders.
		Converted Redeemed often remain outside the Redeemed villages, preferring to remain near to where battles between holy and fiendish warriors are waged but they do have some presence in the southern villages, primarily in the village of Glorious Apex set at the top of hill with a vigorous fresh water spring that provides water to the town and creates a lake half way down the western side of the hill.",
		"Redeemed are often shunned by those that recognise their people and know their lineage seeing them as untrustworthy at best. Redeemed for their part have mostly given up changing the minds of other races and often lean into this portrayal when interacting with them. Those who see the wings of a Converted Redeemed, however, often mistake them for angels or powerful Aasimar. A reputation that they strive to uphold.",
		"Converted Redeemed run the full gamut of alignments but tend to lean towards good with evil individuals being nearly unheard of and most members being neutral good. 
		Most Converted Redeemed revere Sarenrae as their patron goddess as when the Redeemed first took up the fight against evil, she admired their resolve granting them aid and helped them to overcome their demonic tendencies, ultimately granted them the title of Redeemed.",
		"Redeemed often become adventurers either for a taste of adventure or to lead crusades against various demonic forces. A rare few evil ones seek to reinvigorate their demonic connection and seek power. Adventuring is seen as a viable and even normal profession amongst their villages. Many individuals go adventuring as soon as they can and return after reaching great heights. Meaning that their villages have more than their fair sure of high level adventurers in them that often settle down and tell stories to their kids and the other village children of their daring adventures inpiring new generations of adventurers.",
